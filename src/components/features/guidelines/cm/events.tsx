                <div>
                    The following are the responsibilities of the Events, Quests & Market Managers
                </div>

                <li>
                    <span className='font-bold text-attention2'>Be creative. </span>
                    Think of new creative events, quests or markets, never done before. Each month should be something
                    fun for people. Not necessarily big. Many times people see something new and automatically like them,
                    regardless if it's something huge or not.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span className='font-bold text-attention2'>Be perceptive. </span>
                    See how events, quests or markets perform. Why did people not participate as much? Ask around.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span className='font-bold text-attention2'>Lead team discussion. </span>
                    You're responsible for making sure that other Community Managers are giving their
                    input. Listen to their input and adjust accordingly! We are still a team.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span className='font-bold text-attention2'>Deliver Rewards. </span>
                    You're responsible for delivering people their rewards. Easiest way is via spawn and labeling chests.
                </li>

            </ul>
